# Prepare application
* Install requirements before starting, i.e. with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Place SOMLib - dataset files in the 'datasets'-folder
* (optional) somtoolbox must be installed(with non root-permissions) and placed in the root of the working directory and 
    the directory has to be named 'somtoolbox'. This is required if SOMToolbox should be used instead of minisom.
